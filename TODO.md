use scrapped database as new backend

refactor codebase:
- use rich for logging
- use oop
- use polars

convert data manip to JS? or intermediate data format sent to frontend?
make graphs & frontend with d3.js? or other?

build backend api with a real db?

deploy to server (build & test locally)

stats i could add:
 - episodes watched (total time)
 - franchises watched / franchises to watch (will need relational data if we want better stats)
