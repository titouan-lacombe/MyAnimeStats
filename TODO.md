MyAnimeStats V3:
- stats i could add:
  - franchises watched / franchises to watch (will need relational data if we want better stats)
- pretty landing page

MyAnimeStats V4:
- If clustering:
  - TF-IDF -> PCA -> UMAP -> HDBSCAN
- If scraping:
  - try to search better DB with staff/character/franchise data & better scraping
  - add franchise stats (similar to V1)
  - add staff stats (similar to V1) (will need either slow scraping or slow runtime data collection)
  - make prettier frontend with d3.js? or other? (https://streamlit.io/ ?)

V5:
- deploy to server (build & test locally) deploy with static compose, just pull
