MyAnimeStats V3:
- compare bokeh vs https://altair-viz.github.io/
- pretty landing page
- stats i could add:
  - episodes watched (total time)
  - franchises watched / franchises to watch (will need relational data if we want better stats)
- deploy to server (build & test locally)

MyAnimeStats V4:
- try to search better DB with staff/character/franchise data & better scraping
- add franchise stats (similar to V1)
- add staff stats (similar to V1) (will need either slow scraping or slow runtime data collection)
- make prettier frontend with d3.js? or other? (https://streamlit.io/ ?)
